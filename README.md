# Boston-Housing-Dataset

## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes the Boston Housing dataset to uncover key factors that influence housing prices. The workflow includes data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), correlation study, and insight generation. The goal is to demonstrate analytical thinking and visualization skills for real-world data problems.

## 📂 Dataset Description
- **Source**: UCI Machine Learning Repository
- **Rows**: 506
- **Features**: 14 (all numeric)
- **Target Variable**: `MEDV` — Median value of owner-occupied homes in $1000s

---

## 🔍 Objectives
- Clean and preprocess the dataset
- Explore feature distributions and relationships
- Identify features most correlated with housing prices
- Visualize patterns using Plotly and Matplotlib
- Summarize insights for business or client use

---

## 📊 Key Findings
- **RM** (average number of rooms per dwelling) has a strong positive correlation with `MEDV`
- **LSTAT** (percentage of lower status population) shows a strong negative correlation with `MEDV`
- **NOX** (nitric oxides concentration) and **INDUS** (proportion of non-retail business acres) negatively impact housing prices
- **PTRATIO** (pupil-teacher ratio) also shows moderate negative correlation
